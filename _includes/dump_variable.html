  ! unfortunately variables can't be passed as parameters to includes !
  So the variable dump_value will be jsonified. This often leads to a long 
  string without blanks which can't be line wrapped by html. So with some
  replace some blanks are added between syntactic elements. Finally the
  result is truncated to 'max', and the chopped length indicated.

{% assign val_je = dump_value | jsonify | 
    replace: '":','" : '| 
    replace: ',"',' , "'| 
    replace: '},{','} , {' %}
{% assign val_je_tr = val_je | truncate: include.max, "  ....." %}
{% assign nchop =  val_je.size | minus: val_je_tr.size %}
{% if nchop > 0 %}
  {% assign val_je_tr = val_je_tr | 
        append: "(+"  | append: nchop | append: " chars)" %}
{% endif %}
{{ val_je_tr }}
