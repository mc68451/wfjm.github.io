<h2>Who am I</h2>
Since secondary school my interests are physics, electronics and computing.
A brief (and easy to find out) CV:
<ul>
  <li>studied physics at 
    <a href="http://www.uni-koeln.de/">University of Cologne </a>,</li>
  <li>went on to <a href="https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/en/start/">
      Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics</a> in Heidelberg,</li>
  <li>earned a degree in experimental nuclear physics from
    <a href="http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/index_e.html">
      Heidelberg University</a> with an experiment conducted at
    <a href="">CERN</a> on the
    <a href="https://home.cern/about/accelerators/synchrocyclotron">
      Synchrocyclotron</a>,</li>
  <li>worked as post doctoral fellow at
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.gsi.de">GSI</a> in Darmstadt</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.lbl.gov">
          Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL)</a> 
        in Berkeley on experiments at the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevatron">Bevatron</a></li>
    </ul>
  <li>came back to <a href="http://www.gsi.de">GSI</a> when the
    SIS-18 accelerator upgrade started operation,</li>
  <li>and finally engaged in the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facility_for_Antiproton_and_Ion_Research">FAIR</a>
    project.
  </li>
</ul> 

Due to my interest vector <code>[physics,electronics,computing]</code> I
concentrated on the technical aspects of experiments, mainly on the
sectors front-end electronics, data acquisition and data analysis.
Over time I've worked with many
<ul>
  <li>computer architectures:
    IBM System/370,
    DEC PDP-8,
    DEC PDP-9,
    DEC PDP-11,
    CDC 7600,
    DEC PDP-10,
    DEC VAX,
    DEC ALPHA,
    Intel IA-64
  </li>
  <li>operating systems:
    DEC OS/8,
    DEC RT-11,
    DEC RSX-11,
    IBM MVS,
    DEC VMS,
    BSD Unix,
    SUN/OS,
    OS/9,
    Linux
  </li>
  <li>languages: 
    FORTRAN, 
    Simula, 
    PDP-11 assembler, 
    PL/I, 
    C, 
    C++,
    HTML,
    Perl,
    SQL,
    VHDL,
    Tcl
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
My initial contact with computers was a IBM/360 assembler course during
secondary school, and later during under-graduate times via 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">
  punched cards</a> which were send via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_job_entry">
  remote job entry (RJE)</a> stations to a mainframe computer.
</p>

<p>
The first real hands-on experience was with 
DEC PDP-11
systems running under
RT-11
and
RSX-11. 
These systems were used for many years as central element in data acquisition
systems, and my role was often to squeeze the last grain of performance out
of them. So I naturally learned a lot about the hardware and software stack.
</p>

<p>
I've started building electronics gadgets during secondary school times, 
based on very basic

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series">SN7400</a> series 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic">
  TTL</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4000_series">CD4000</a> series
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS">CMOS</a>
circuits. 
Later my focus was mainly on using electronics and computers in the most 
efficient way, but in one occasion I had to manage the design and 
implementation of a quite complex electronics system, learned in depth
to use
FPGA's
and
DSP's,
and ended up to write all the FPGA firmware in VHDL.
</p>

<p>
In 2007 I was looking for a nice but ambitious pastime project. 
By chance I stumbled over a box with a bunch of old DEC PDP-11 manuals.
Combined with my old affection to PDP-11's that quickly became what now
is the <a href="/home/w11/">w11 project</a>.
Quickly 
2.11BSD 
became the prime candidate for the operating system to run on my w11,
which in turn triggered my 
<a href="/blogs/211bsd/">2.11BSD</a>
and the
<a href="http://www.retro11.de/docs/ouxr/html/index.html">
'Old Unix Cross Reference' (ouxr)</a>
activities.
