    board: S3BOARD
    link:  digi_s3board
    state: dormant
    comm:  My very first board, all initial w11 development was done with it.
           Performance of the rlink over a 460k Baud RS232 link is modest,
           enough for initial proof-of-principle studies, but a bit slow
           for practical usage. See also <a href="../../downloads/w11/pictures/wfjm-2010-08-08-w11a_s3.jpg">picture</a>.

    board: Nexys2
    link:  digi_nexys2
    state: active
    comm:  The Cypress FX2 USB interface gave a real performance boost, the
           rlink concept finally worked out. Full usage of the 22 bit
           address space thanks to the easy to interface PSRAM memory.

    board: Atlys
    link:  digi_atlys
    state: unused
    comm:  The first Spartan-6 based board. However, interfacing the DDR2 memory
           was suspended when the Nexys3 arrived, and in fact never completed.
           The Atlys board is used in other projects, but not for w11.

    board: Nexys3
    link:  digi_nexys3
    state: active
    comm:  Great Spartan-6 based board, with easy to interface PSRAM memory. It
           gave also a modest performance boost, the w11 system clock increased
           to 64 MHz from 50 MHz. Of all my boards this one has the smallest
           FPGA size, the current w11a design uses 93% of the slices.
           The w11 will soon outgrow this board.

    board: Nexys4
    link:  digi_nexys4
    state: broken
    comm:  The first Series-7 based board. Initial development was done with
           ISE 14.7, but switched quickly to Vivado. A much better IDE,
           code development was fun again, essentially all development
           was done on the Nexys4. W11 system clock increased to 80 MHz.
           The board broke unfortunately in July 2019.

    board: Basys3
    link:  digi_basys3
    state: active
    comm:  Just cute. No on board memory, so w11 sees only 176 kByte memory
           implemented with BRAMs.
  - date:  2016 Feb
    board: Arty
    link:  digi_arty
    state: active
    comm:  This board has the best cost/performance ratio of all my boards.
           It took quite some time to get the DDR3 memory interface operating,
           but ever since this board is one of the main development boards.
           Very nice is the build-in current monitor.

    board: CModA7
    link:  digi_cmoda7
    state: active
    comm:  A real gadget, certainly the most compact setup I have. The 35T
           die size is more than enough for a w11. The 512 kByte on board
           memory combined with some BRAMs result in 672 kByte visible to
           the w11 CPU, enough to run a trimmed down 211bsd system.

    board: Nexys4 A7
    link:  digi_nexys4d
    state: ordered
    comm:  The Arty board is nice and from a purely function point all one
           needs. But I like the LEDs of the Nexys series boards, the perfect
           board for a <i>blinking lights</i> w11. So I ordered a Nexys A7
           board, formerly known as Nexys4 DDR, as replacement for the broken
           Nexys4 <i>classic</i>.
