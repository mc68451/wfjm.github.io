<h2>FPSIM fixed; 211bsd runs on systems without FPP</h2>

<p>
Some time ago I looked into running 2.11bsd on systems without
floating point unit. The release notes state that this is untested
and unsupported, and indeed it didn't work.
</p>
<p>
Robin Birch some time ago fixed part of the issues, see patch 434,
but still the kernel paniced when the very first program was started.
I managed to localize and fix the problem in <code>sys/pdp/mch_fpsim.s</code>.
</p>
<p>
Steven Schultz right away issued 2.11BSD patch #445. All patches
up to and including 445 are provided by Steven under
</p>
<pre>
   ftp://sg-1.ims.ideas.gd-ais.com/pub/2.11BSD
</pre>
A patch level 445 system will now boot on simh for example on a
<pre>
   set cpu 11/70 nofpp 4m
</pre>
configuration and work just fine, albeit a little slower.
<p>
It should thus also work on a real 11/70 without FPP. I heard
of some 11/70 with non-working FPP's, so this maybe good news
for the owners.
