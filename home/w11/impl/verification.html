<h2>Test Benches</h2>
The project contains self-checking test benches for several components,
the w11a core as well as for the whole systems under

See 
<a href="{{site.w11_blob}}/doc/w11a_tb_guide.txt">w11a_tb_guide.txt</a> 
for detail instructions to run these test benches.

<h2>Test Programs</h2>
The CPU core as well as the peripherals have been verified in ghdl simulation
and in FPGA with test programs. The list of acceptable implementation
differences as well as the a list of issues to be resolved in upcoming
revisions is summarized in
<a href="{{site.w11_blob}}/doc/w11a_known_issues.txt">w11a_known_issues.txt</a>.
