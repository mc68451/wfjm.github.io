<h2>Microarchitecture</h2>
Because the w11a microarchitecture is very similar to the original 11/70 
processor, the KB11-C CPU, the instruction timing in clock cycles is also very
similar.  A register-register operation takes two clock cycles, more a
involved case like an "<code>add @r1,a(r2)</code>" for example takes 12 cycles. 
Notable exceptions are the MUL (5 instead of 22 cycles) and DIV (23
instead of 46 cycles) instructions.

<h2>Clock Rate</h2>
On Spartan/Artix classs FPGA's the w11a systems run with at a clock frequency
of at <b>least 50 MHz</b>. Specifically:
<pre>
  FPGA          board     system        clock   comment
  xc7a35t-1     Arty      w11a_br_arty  80 MHz   uses MMCM (with Vivado 2016.2)
  xc7a35t-1     Basys3    w11a_b3       80 MHz   uses MMCM (with Vivado 2016.2)
  xc7a100t-1    Nexys4    w11a_n4       80 MHz   uses MMCM (with Vivado 2016.2)
  xc6slx16-2    Nexys3    w11a_n3       64 MHz   uses DCM  (with ISE 14.7)
  xc3s1200e-4   Nexys2    w11a_n2       52 MHz   uses DCM
  xc3s1000-4    S3board   w11a_s3       50 MHz   no DCM
</pre>

<h2>Expected Performance</h2>
<p>
<b>Compared to KB11-C CPU</b>: The KB11-C CPU had a 150 ns micro cycle time. 
Both the w11a and the 11/70 have a cache, which greatly reduces the impact
of memory latencies. So one expects that the w11a is about a factor 
50/6.7 or 7.5 faster than the original PDP-11/70.
</p>
<p>
<b>Compared to J11 CPU</b>: This later ASIC implementation of the 11/70 ran
with up to 20 MHz clock rate. It needed 4 clocks per microcycle, resulting 
in a 200 ns micro cycle time. However, the J11 had a significantly improved
microarchitecture yielding an up to a factor two better 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycles_per_instruction">cpi</a> 
(cycles-per-instruction) value. So one expects that the w11a is at least
a factor (50/20)*(4/1)*(1/2) or 5 faster than the fastest J11 based system,
the PDP-11/93.

Note that the J11 system is listed with the effective microcycle rate of 
4.5 MHz rather the chip clock rate of 18 MHz. This is also consistent with
<a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/semi/j11.html">
  Bob Supnik's notes on the J11</a> 
were the J11 is classified as '4.5 MHz'. This gives a more meaningful
values for the Dhry/MHz or 'Dhrystone per MHz' column. For a fair comparison 
it is also important to remark that the PDP-11/53+ systems didn't have a 
cache and were therefore about a factor 2.3 slower than a PDP-11/93 with cache
(see 
<a href="http://www.village.org/pdp11/faq.pages/prfmnc.html">comparison</a>),
explaining the large factor between the w11a_s3 and the 11/53 benchmark results.

<p>
The Dhrystone, Tower of Hanoi and 'syscall' benchmarks were also run on a 
<b>simulated PDP-11</b> using 
<a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">simh</a> 
version V3.8-1 and <b>natively</b> on a Linux system.
In both cases a Kubuntu 10.4 system with an Intel Core2 Duo 
<a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=33910">E8400</a> CPU
was used, 
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/cpufreq/cpufreq.html">
cpufreg</a> was fixed to 3 GHz.

Some observations are:
<ul>
  <li>The Nexys2 and Nexys3 boards have a significantly larger main memory 
      latency than the S3BOARD. Because Dhry2 and Hanoi run almost completely 
      in cache and do rarely writes they execute with equal speed. syscall is 
      more sensitive to memory latencies, either due to more cache misses or 
      delays from  write-thru's.</li>
  <li>The simulated PDP-11 on a modern 3 GHz PC is about as fast as the current
      FPGA implementation on a Spartan-6. However, there is certainly room for
      improvement on the FPGA side, either with a faster devices (e.g. a 
      Virtex-6 instead of a Spartan-6) and/or an improved microarchitecture
      (like J11 or even better).</li>
  <li>Comparing the arithmetic benchmarks (Dhry2 and Hanoi) with the 'syscall'
      benchmark on simh-simulated 2.11BSD and native Linux suggests that the
      system call overhead, normalized by processor speed, is larger for
      contemporary Linux than for 2.11BSD.</li>
</ul>
