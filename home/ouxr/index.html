<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>
The bring-up of UNIX 2.11BSD on the <a href="/home/w11/">w11</a> system
required a lot of very detailed studies of the source code. That called
quickly for a hyperlinked and cross referenced rendition of the sources,
much like <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">doxygen</a> or
<a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/">lxr</a> does it.
The desired features were:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>cover boot, kernel, networking, library and user level code</li>
  <li>cover C, assembler and other relevant languages</li>
  <li>provide 'what is used where' information, over the whole system</li>
  <li>provide hyperlinks for a fast code path analysis, especially
    across the user,library,kernel interfaces</li>
  <li>support to follow the execution logic of a system call starting from
    user code, through the library layer, through the kernel interface, to
    the kernel code by just following hyperlinks</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>
Since none of the existing tools seemed to match that profile a new tool
was written. The task is strongly simplified by the facts
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the code base is quasi static, very low update rate</li>
  <li>the size of the code base is small by today's standards and allows
    to hold the full code base in memory for analysis</li>
</ul>
