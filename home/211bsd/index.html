<h2 id="h_overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
Released in 1992, this end-point of historical UNIX development on PDP-11's
uses almost all features (22 bit addressing, separate I/D space, 3 processor
modes) to squeeze a full UNIX with most of the 4.3 BSD features into a 16 bit
machine. This operating system can be freely used under the
<a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/Archive/Caldera-license.pdf">
  Caldera license</a>
and is therefore the prime operating system for the
<a href="/home/w11/">w11</a> project.

<h3 id="h_patches">2.11BSD Patches</h3>
<p>
When bringing up 2.11BSD in the <a href="/home/w11">w11a</a> CPU two loose
ends in the kernel showed up and were fixed with a patch
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the floating point emulator FPSIM didn't work. Fixed with
    <a href="/blogs/211bsd/2007-01-03-patch-445.html">
      patch #445</a>.</li>
  <li>boot from a RK05 wasn't possible. Fixed, together with several other
    little issues, with
    <a href="/blogs/211bsd/2009-01-04-patch-446+447.html">
      patch #446+447</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h_ouxr">2.11BSD Source Code Viewer</h3>
<p>
The work on the patches mentioned above required a lot of detail studies
of the 2.11BSD source code, so it was natural to look for fully htmlized
and cross-references source code view. Since none of the available tooks
covered the requirements a new tool was was written. For more info see

<h3 id="h_images">2.11BSD System Images</h3>
<p>
A number of ready to use 2.11BSD system images are provided for usage on w11a
or on simh in a configuration equivalent to a w11a.
Details are provided in the
